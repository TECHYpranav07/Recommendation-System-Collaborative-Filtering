# 🎯 Internship Task 4 – Recommendation System

This project focuses on building a **Recommendation System** using **Collaborative Filtering** with **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**.

---

## 📌 Objective

To develop a recommendation system capable of suggesting items to users based on historical user-item interactions using techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

---

## 📂 Files

- `Recommendation_System_SVD.ipynb` – The main Jupyter notebook containing:
  - Data preprocessing
  - SVD model implementation
  - Recommendation generation
  - Evaluation using RMSE

---

## 🛠️ Techniques Used

- Collaborative Filtering
- Matrix Factorization (SVD)
- Evaluation Metric: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

---

## 📊 Dataset

> Dataset used: MovieLens (or the dataset used in your notebook—replace with actual one if different)

---

## 🧪 Evaluation

The system was evaluated using:
- Train/Test Split
- RMSE to measure prediction accuracy

---

## 🧠 Future Work

- Implementing item-based and user-based kNN
- Adding content-based filtering features
- Creating a web interface for real-time recommendations

---

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open `Recommendation_System_SVD.ipynb` and run all cells
